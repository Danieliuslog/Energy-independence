# Lithuania's Energy Independence Possibility

## This analysis was done by a group of ISM sutdents including myself to assess Lithuania's position and capability of becoming energy independent, primarily from wind energy. The main programming languages used were Python and SQL. The project focuses on various topics:

## 1) Lithuania's current energy mix
## 2) Energy consumption and projections
## 3) Lithuania's energy balance comparison to that of the EU
## 4) Existing wind power infrastructure
## 5) Environmental impact and self-sufficiency

## Each of these subtopics try to answer their own hypotheses. In the end, combining the insights gained from all subtopics let's us conclude, that transitioning to wind power is a viable pathway for Lithuania to achieve energy independence and meet environmental objectives.
